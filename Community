https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/netdev-FAQ.html#q-what-is-netdev

all network-related Linux development (i.e. RFC, review, comments, etc.) takes place on netdev.

There are always two trees (git repositories) in play. Both are driven by David Miller, the main network maintainer.

the net tree is for fixes to existing code already in the mainline tree from Linus, and net-next is where the new code goes for the future release.

At the beginning of the 2-week merge window, the net-next tree will be closed - no new changes/features. The accumulated new content of the past ~10 weeks will be passed onto mainline/Linus via a pull request for vX.Y â€“ at the same time, the net tree will start accumulating fixes for this pulled content relating to vX.Y

Shortly after the two weeks have passed (and vX.Y-rc1 is released), the tree for net-next reopens to collect content for the next (vX.Y+1) release.
